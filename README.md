  Forest Protector, a platform aimed to forecast, report, and prevent wildfires.
What it does
Our app forest protector currently allows users to signup and shows a map with reported wildfires retrieved directly from NASA. For each wildfire that is indicated on Google Maps, it has images that people upload from the actual location, below that we have some information about the time, location, and name of the fire. We also provide links for users to know more about this incident. Finally, we also made a histogram analyzing the statistics through wildfires that happens within roughly a radius of 300 kilometers.

For our login page, we used Userfront to help us securely record the signup data. We used React and javascript to build our website, we also used Google map API and NASA API to retrieve the most recent wildfire information. For our backend, we used CockroachDB + typescript with Prisma to store the data of users, posts, geographical information, wildfire records, and histories.

  You have a chance to learn more about the wildfire and its impact by simply clicking on the link icon (then you will be redirected to the external official website). We also use our own algorithm to present to you a histogram of the frequencies of wildfires in the local area that occured in each month during the past year.

## Development
This project is written in React.js. To get started,
* Clone the repo
* Run (`npm install`) then (`npm start`)
* You will then be prompted to your localhost for the webapp

## Built with 

- [React](https://reactjs.org)
- [NASA EONET API](https://eonet.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/v2.1#categoriesAPI)
- [CockroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com) + Typescript with [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io) to store the data of users, posts, geographical information, wildfire records and histories
- [Userfront](https://userfront.com) for user authentication

## To-do
* Implement location search engine
  * Pop up to retrieve user's permission for geo-location first
* Support real-time connection with nearest fire stations to help fight against wildfires
* Allow users to post comments and pictures that will be stored in our database
